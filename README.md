# page-transitions-travelapp-nonuxt
Adaptation of Sarah Drasner's Travel App

I created this adaptation to show how the awesome transitions that Sarah Drasner created can be used without Nuxt.js. I kept seeing Sarah use Nuxt which made me thing there was something special about Nuxt and the ability to do page transitions. This shows how you just need to update state when routing to achieve the same results.
